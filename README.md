# To-Do List API

This project is an API built using C# and .NET Core with Entity Framework for managing a simple To-Do List application. The primary goal of the API is to provide endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting task items from the to-do list.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete items in a to-do list.
- **CRUD Operations**: Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on task items.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses Entity Framework Core for database operations and data management.

## Architecture & Design

In this project, I applied several best practices and design principles:

- **Clean Architecture**: The project structure is based on Clean Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability.
- **SOLID Principles**: The code follows SOLID design principles to enhance maintainability, readability, and extensibility.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: DDD concepts were implemented to model the domain effectively and ensure that business logic remains clear and separate from infrastructure code.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The development process followed TDD, ensuring that code is thoroughly tested through unit tests.
- **Unit Testing with xUnit**: Unit tests were written using xUnit to verify the functionality of the API. Tests ensure that the business logic works as expected, and edge cases are properly handled.

## Documentation

- **Swagger**: The API is documented using Swagger, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the API and test endpoints directly from the browser.
